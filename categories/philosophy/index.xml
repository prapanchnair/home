      <description>Did Aryans invade India, did they migrate to India or did they originate in India and travelled to illuminate the rest of the world? - A very debate topic among linguists, historians and archeologists alike. Here is my verdict on this debate: It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
This question about the origin of Aryans, like many similar historical origin puzzles elsewhere in the world is a deeply emotional one. The emotion rises out of a number of failures we face as a population.</description>

      <description>Religious secularism has become an intensely debated idea all over the world today. In secular India, especially, secular opinions are sometimes discredited as giving too much leeway for people with vested interests to take advantage of. Secularism as an idea is growing subtler and from there it could soon become ambiguous. There are instances where secular movements are equated to anti-national movements especially when the interests seem to conflict. This is where I feel the need to share my understanding of it.</description>
