      <description>&lt;p&gt;In research as a career it is becoming progressively difficult to find ones place in the ramifications of knowledge. Knowledge in any major science now stands as a giant tree with countless branches. No one person has a grand narrative. We are all perched randomly, sometimes even on the weakest of branches and no one person seems to have the grand narrative for it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I can only imagine that this tree will ramify exponentially. As I think about this expansion of knowledge,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that one can reach successfully venture through these branches of the tree of knowledge to finally contribute at the tip of a branch, is by
taking the parent branches for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
