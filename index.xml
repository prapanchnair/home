      <description>Did Aryans invade India, did they migrate to India or did they originate in India and travelled to illuminate the rest of the world? - A very debate topic among linguists, historians and archeologists alike. Here is my verdict on this debate: It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
This question about the origin of Aryans, like many similar historical origin puzzles elsewhere in the world is a deeply emotional one. The emotion rises out of a number of failures we face as a population.</description>

      <description>Religious secularism has become an intensely debated idea all over the world today. In secular India, especially, secular opinions are sometimes discredited as giving too much leeway for people with vested interests to take advantage of. Secularism as an idea is growing subtler and from there it could soon become ambiguous. There are instances where secular movements are equated to anti-national movements especially when the interests seem to conflict. This is where I feel the need to share my understanding of it.</description>

      <description>In research as a career it is becoming progressively difficult to find ones place in the ramifications of knowledge. Knowledge in any major science now stands as a giant tree with countless branches. No one person has a grand narrative. We are all perched randomly, sometimes even on the weakest of branches and no one person seems to have the grand narrative for it all.
In the near future, I can only imagine that this tree will ramify exponentially.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
