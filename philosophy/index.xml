      <description>&lt;p&gt;Religious secularism has become an intensely debated idea all over the world today.
In secular India, especially, secular opinions are sometimes discredited as giving too much
leeway for people with vested interests to take advantage of. Secularism as an idea
is growing subtler and from there it could soon become ambiguous. This is where I
feel the need to share my understanding of it. I am a Hindu. The more my intellectual
exploration of existence grew, the more I found fitting into the definition of a Hindu.
I know close to nothing about other religions. From the hinduism tinted view, here
is my take on secularism. After all, we need the idea of secularism between religions.
Hence an atheist&amp;rsquo;s view of secularism doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold practical value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To present the idea of secularism from the point of view of a Hindu, I must introduce
the religion or the point of this religion.&lt;/p&gt;
