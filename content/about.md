I Research and develop numerical methods for solving multiphase fluid flows involving interfaces of different kinds. I have authored a C code that uses the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. I like to think out loud about life and work and Iam constantly seeking understanding of all this. I am putting it out here to find like minded people.  <br>
