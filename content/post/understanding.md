title: Understanding something
---

In research as a career it is becoming progressively difficult to find ones place in the ramifications of knowledge. Knowledge in any major science now stands as a giant tree with countless branches. No one person has a grand narrative. We are all perched randomly, sometimes even on the weakest of branches and no one person seems to have the grand narrative for it all. 

In the near future, I can only imagine that this tree will ramify exponentially. As I think about this expansion of knowledge, 


that one can reach successfully venture through these branches of the tree of knowledge to finally contribute at the tip of a branch, is by 
taking the parent branches for granted.
