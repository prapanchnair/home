As kids we were naturally happy. The festival days brought about even more happiness, exhilaration. With no worries in our bellies we  ate all we could. As we grew up, we had reasons to be unhappy about life. We saw flaws in people and things around us; we didn't like our governments and our laws; we stopped accepting ourselves. After riding cars and honking at poor old people all year long, we gave advice on environment friendly, noiseless Diwali celebrations. This is because the realm of our senses widened as we grew older, and started obsessing over deficiencies within us and outside us. Today, most of us celebrate festivals only as a continuation of tradition with a large force of cynicism pushing against us.
